            <p>"Channel" is common in IRC, it is also works in Mindtalk. But you can take Mindtalk's channel as a home for everybody all over the place to stay. While in terms of a forum, it's the sub forum. Inside a channel there exist some components like Admin, Users, and Posts.
                User could make channel just as the same as in IRC. Let say, you are trying to make an airsoft gun channel.
                So, in the posting box, you just have to write #airsoftgun. And it will automatically create your airsoft gun channel/category.</p>

            <p>Any stream included in each category could loop to another category with a help of a hashtag (#) sign. As a lively forum has to operate, user (which is you and your friends) are free to make any category suits you. Mindtalk has realtime notification. Sharing any file would be as easy as breathing. Each of you has the potential to be admin on available categories.</p>
